# openpicks

This is a clojure version of the app that I wrote to manage our Football pool at work.

General Rules:
* All picks for the week must be made by kickoff of the first game.
* Tie breaker is the point difference between the game of the week (usually Monday night football)
* Determines weekly pool winners, as well as the winners for the season.
